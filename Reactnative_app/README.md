## 📖 Project Overview

This project transforms an Android smartphone into the "brain" of an autonomous mobile robot. Leveraging the phone's powerful sensors, camera, and connectivity, it acts as a central cortex that processes vision, voice, and decision-making logic locally on the device.

The complete system integrates **Face Recognition**, **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**, **Obstacle Avoidance**, and **Media Playback** into a cohesive, personality-driven AI Assistant.

### ✨ Key Features

*   **🗣️ Advanced Voice Control**: Speak naturally to issue commands ("Follow me", "Play music", "Stop"). robust Intent Parsing handles variations in speech.
*   **👁️ Facial Recognition & Emotion AI**: Identifies owners vs. guests and adapts responses based on user emotion (Happy, Sad, Neutral).
*   **🧠 Decision Engine**: A centralized arbitration system that prioritizes Safety > User Commands > Autonomous Behaviors.
*   **🚗 Navigation & Safety**: Includes obstacle avoidance logic, virtual physics simulation for testing, and visual tracking for "Follow Me" mode.
*   **🎵 Media Integration**: Hands-free playback control for YouTube and music, with "Now Playing" status in the admin panel.
*   **⚡ Power Management**: Adaptive behavior that degrades gracefully (reduces sensor polling, disables heavy AI) to save battery.
*   **📅 Task Scheduling**: Remembers to remind you of tasks ("Remind me to water plants in 30 minutes").
*   **🎛️ Admin Debug Dashboard**: A comprehensive "Mission Control" UI for real-time telemetry (Vision fps, Motor status, Battery load, Sensor data).

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-native-robot-brain.git
cd react-native-robot-brain
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 3. Android Configuration
Ensure your Android device is connected with **USB Debugging** enabled.
1.  Open `android/` folder in Android Studio to sync Gradle.
2.  Add necessary permissions (Camera, Microphone, Bluetooth) in `AndroidManifest.xml` (already included in repo).

### 4. Run the App
```bash
# Start Metro Bundler
npm start

# Install on Android Device
npm run android
```

## 🧠 AI Brain Setup (Local Llama 3.2)

The robot uses a local **Llama 3.2** model via **Ollama** for advanced conversational intelligence.

### 1. Install Ollama
Download and install Ollama from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com).

### 2. Download the Model
Run the following command to download the 3B model (optimized for speed/mobile):
```bash
ollama pull llama3.2:3b
```

### 3. Run Ollama with External Access
By default, Ollama only listens to `localhost`. To allow the Android app to connect, you must set the host environment variable:

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0 ollama serve
```

## 📦 Building & Transferring APK (Native Android)

To test on a real device with **Native Voice Recognition**, you must build a standalone APK.

### 1. Prerequisites (Setup Java)
Android builds require **JDK 17**. If you are on macOS:

```bash
# Install JDK 17 via Homebrew
brew install openjdk@17

# Link it to your system
sudo ln -sfn /opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk@17/libexec/openjdk.jdk /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/openjdk-17.jdk
```

### 2. Generate Native Project
If you haven't already, generate the native `android/` directory:
```bash
npx expo prebuild --platform android
```

### 3. Build the APK (Gradle)
Run the build script from the android folder:
```bash
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug
```
**APK Location:** `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

---

### 🛡️ Building without Android Studio (Lightweight Mode)

If you don't want to install the heavy Android Studio IDE, you can set up a headless build environment using Homebrew:

1.  **Install Command Line Tools**:
    ```bash
    brew install --cask android-commandlinetools android-platform-tools
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment Variables** (Add to `~/.zshrc`):
    ```bash
    export ANDROID_HOME=/opt/homebrew/share/android-commandlinetools
    export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
    export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/cmdline-tools/latest/bin
    export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
    
    # Ensure Java 17 is linked
    export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v 17)
    ```

3.  **Accept Licenses & Install SDK Components**:
    ```bash
    # Accept all licenses
    yes | sdkmanager --licenses

    # Install specific project requirements
    sdkmanager "platforms;android-36" "build-tools;36.0.0" "platform-tools" "ndk;27.1.12297006"
    ```

4.  **Local Properties**:
    Ensure `android/local.properties` contains:
    `sdk.dir=/opt/homebrew/share/android-commandlinetools`

---

### ⚠️ Troubleshooting Build Errors

#### **Java heap space / Out of Memory**
If the build fails with `Java heap space` during the "Jetify" task, you need to give Gradle more memory:
1. Open `android/gradle.properties`.
2. Find `org.gradle.jvmargs` and increase it to:
   ```properties
   org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx4096m -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=512m
   ```

## 📲 Transferring APK to Android

Choose one of these methods to move the file from your Mac to your Phone:

### Method A: Direct Install (ADB) - Fastest
Connect your phone via USB with **USB Debugging** enabled.
```bash
# Install ADB if missing
brew install --cask android-platform-tools

# Install APK directly
adb install android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk

> **💡 Pro Tip:** To see the robot's "brain" logs (what it's hearing, thinking, and Llama's responses) in real-time while it runs on your phone, run:
> ```bash
> adb logcat *:S ReactNative:V ReactNativeJS:V
> ```
```


### Method B: Wireless Transfer (Snapdrop)
1. Open **[Snapdrop.net](https://snapdrop.net/)** on both your Mac and Android phone (must be on same Wi-Fi).
2. Click the icon on your Mac and select the `app-debug.apk`.
3. Accept the download on your phone and Install.

### Method C: Local Web Server (Python)
1. In your terminal:
   ```bash
   cd android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```
2. On your phone's browser, visit: `YOUR_MAC_IP:8000` (e.g., `192.168.1.5:8000`).
3. Tap the file to download and install.

## 🔌 Integration & Hardware Setup

### Bluetooth Motor Controller (Optional)
If connecting to a physical robot base:
1.  Flash your ESP32/Arduino with firmware that accepts serial strings (e.g., `'FORWARD'`, `'STOP'`).
2.  Pair the Android phone with the Bluetooth module.
3.  In `src/services/RobotService.js`, set `USE_BLUETOOTH = true` and update the `DEVICE_NAME`.

### Simulation Mode
Don't have hardware yet? The app defaults to **Simulation Mode**.
*   **Virtual Motors**: The app simulates physics, position, and movement.
*   **Manual Obstacles**: You can "inject" fake obstacles via the Admin Panel to test avoidance logic.

---

## 🕹️ Usage Instructions

### 1. Launching the Brain
*   Open the app. You will see the **User Mode** screen (Face Scan active).
*   **Authorize**: Once your face is recognized (default: 'OWNER_001'), the system unlocks personalized commands.

### 2. Voice Commands
Tap the microphone or enable "Always Listen" (if configured). Try saying:
*   *"Follow me"* — Starts visual tracking.
*   *"Stop" / "Halt"* — Emergency stop.
*   *"Play [Song Name]"* — Opens simple web player or YouTube intent.
*   *"Remind me to [Task] in [X] minutes"* — Schedules a task.
*   *"How are you?"* — Checks status and battery.

### 3. Admin Debug Panel
Navigate to the **Admin** tab to see the system internals:
*   **Cortex Link**: Shows what the Decision Engine is "thinking" (IDLE, FOLLOW, AVOID).
*   **Vision Feed**: Real-time camera stream with face bounding boxes and emotion labels.
*   **Sensor Array**: Live distance data (real or simulated).
*   **Energy Core**: Battery health and power mode.
